        Power to the Reader is an online book review network that connects us
        together because of our love of books. Our mission is to share that love
        for books to as many people as we can reach. To provide inspiration, and
        motivation to our readers by giving personal insight needed to help find
        their next read or possibly favorite book. Basically, this serves as a
        hub for bookworms. Enjoy!

        Hi there! I am Bukunmi. I'm the creator and manager of this website. I
        am deeply passionate about reading and the personal differences in
        interpretations of books. Power to the Reader is a means for me to
        communicate analysis of different books, author bios, and just general
        book talk. It's also a way for me to know other's inputs, like i stated
        earlier it is always nice to hear other people's take on things. You can
        view this as an online version of a book club. I believe you can inspire
        and be inspired today, just browse with an open mind. Welcome to Power
        to the Reader!
      </p>
